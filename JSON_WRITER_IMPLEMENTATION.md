# JSON Writer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented task 10 "Implement JSON output writer" from the RMP scraper specification. This includes creating a comprehensive JSONWriter class that handles serialization, validation, file writing, and summary report generation.

## Components Implemented

### 1. JSONWriter Class (`src/utils/json_writer.py`)

#### Core Methods:
- **`serialize_professors(professors)`**: Converts Professor objects to dictionaries for JSON serialization
- **`write_json(data, output_file)`**: Writes serialized data to JSON file with UTF-8 encoding and proper formatting
- **`validate_json_structure(data)`**: Validates JSON structure before writing to ensure data integrity
- **`save_professors(professors, output_file)`**: Complete workflow combining serialization, validation, and writing

#### Summary Report Methods:
- **`generate_summary_report(professors, errors, skipped)`**: Generates comprehensive statistics including:
  - Total professors scraped
  - Total reviews collected
  - Average reviews per professor
  - Professors by department
  - Error count and list
  - Skipped professors list
  
- **`log_summary_report(summary)`**: Logs the summary to console and log file with formatted output
- **`save_summary_report(summary, output_file)`**: Saves summary report to JSON file

### 2. Main.py Integration

#### Updates Made:
- Imported `JSONWriter` class
- Modified `run_scraping_workflow()` to return tuple of `(professors, errors, skipped_professors)`
- Added error and skipped professor tracking throughout the workflow
- Updated `save_professors_to_json()` to use JSONWriter instead of direct JSON writing
- Added summary report generation and logging in `main()` function
- Summary report saved to `scraping_summary.json` alongside main output

### 3. Test File (`test_json_writer.py`)

Created comprehensive test suite that validates:
- Serialization of Professor objects
- JSON structure validation
- File writing with UTF-8 encoding
- Summary report generation
- Complete workflow integration
- All tests pass successfully

## Features

### Data Quality
- UTF-8 encoding ensures proper handling of special characters
- JSON indentation (2 spaces) for readability
- Structure validation before writing
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging

### Summary Reports
- Comprehensive statistics on scraping operation
- Department-level breakdown
- Error tracking and reporting
- Skipped professor tracking
- Both console logging and JSON file output

### Error Handling
- Handles IO errors gracefully
- Validates data structure before writing
- Logs all errors with context
- Returns boolean success indicators

## Requirements Satisfied

✓ **Requirement 4.4**: UTF-8 encoding for JSON output
✓ **Requirement 5.1**: Single JSON file output with hierarchical structure
✓ **Requirement 5.5**: Valid JSON that can be parsed without errors
✓ **Requirement 6.6**: Summary report with total professors, reviews, and errors

## Output Files

1. **`usf_professors.json`**: Main output file with all professor and review data
2. **`scraping_summary.json`**: Summary report with statistics and error information
3. **`scraper.log`**: Detailed log file with all operations and errors

## Testing

Run the test file to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_json_writer.py
```

All tests pass successfully, confirming:
- Proper serialization
- Valid JSON structure
- UTF-8 encoding
- Summary report generation
- Error handling

## Next Steps

The JSON writer is now fully integrated into the scraping workflow. When the scraper runs, it will:
1. Collect all professor data
2. Serialize and validate the data
3. Write to `usf_professors.json`
4. Generate and save a summary report to `scraping_summary.json`
5. Log comprehensive statistics to console and log file
